# Model weights / outputs
# If your weight files (e.g., volov8n.pt) are large and you do NOT want to track them in Git, ignore the weights directory:
weights/
# Alternatively, you can track only some small files, but typically model weights are large: consider Git LFS instead.
# If you DO want to commit small custom weights, remove or adjust this line accordingly.

# If config.py contains API keys or secrets, do not commit it. Instead, commit config.template.py and ignore config.py:
